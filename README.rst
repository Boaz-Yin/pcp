Principal Component Pursuit in Python
=====================================

This is a Python implementation of the `Principal Component
Pursuit <http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3599>`_ algorithm for robust PCA.

This implementation uses the `fbpca <http://fbpca.readthedocs.org/>`_
implementation of approximate partial SVD for speed so you'll need to install
that first.
